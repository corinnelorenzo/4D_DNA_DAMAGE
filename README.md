# 4DNAFOCI: Standardized Framework for Streamlined 4D DNA Damage Mapping.

We present a semi-automated image analysis approach for visualizing and quantitatively mapping the spatio-temporal distribution of DNA damage foci within tumor spheroids. The developed computational workflow yields quantitative 4D maps, providing insights into the dynamics of DNA damage foci formation within the context of 3D cell cultures. Our methodology seamlessly integrates image processing, machine learning, and spatial analysis, establishing a robust framework for in-depth exploration of DNA damage and tumor spheroid behavior. It is based on the use of FIJI, Ilastik, code block, and Jupyter Notebook. This approach provides valuable insights into the dynamics of DNA damage foci formation within the context of 3D cell cultures. This repository contains the necessary macros, code, and notebooks to generate 4D maps of DNA damage in tumor spheroids.
